Things TODO
===========

* End Turn/Pass button - make it a wheel with all the colours in segments around the wheel, passing rotates the wheel.

* On main UI, show segment of influence track above action board (show right-most 2 discs and current empty circle).  Take action by dragging the disc to the action board.

* Make HudLayer info context-sensitive.  When taking an action, hovering above each action updates the layer with relevant information.
    * Explore: outline all legal hexes with I, II or III in them, HudLayer shows # of hexes left
    * Influence: show segment of influence track, colony ships
    * Research: supply board and current science are relevant
    * Upgrade: available ship parts and ship blueprints are relevant
    * Build: current minerals, available ships, costs
    * Move: Ship speeds, highlight ships

* Show everyone's influence discs stacked on the action board.  Clicking a disc shows a summary of the public information about that action (and temporarily updates the action board to the relevant race).  This is especially useful if using the simultaneous actions option.

* Start menu: selecting number of players (AI and human), selecting colours/species, including/excluding optional elements (such as Rise of the Ancients pieces).  Multiplayer options (hotseat vs. online vs. PBEM).

* Drawing technologies

* Action phase.

* Combat phase.

* Upkeep phase.

* Cleanup phase.

Done
====

* Scrolling UI now handles arbitrary resizes, using the whole window.

* Action board on main UI changes to match the current player's species

* Species data is in separate json files, including their ship blueprints
