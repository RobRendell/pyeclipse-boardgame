Python version of the board game "Eclipse" by Touko Tahkokallio

This is a fork from this project on google-code

    https://code.google.com/p/pyeclipse-boardgame/

created by Jean-Guillaume Louis.  His last commit was in 2012, because he
started working on a Unity-based version of the game after seeing the iPad
version by Big Daddy's Creations.

However, I corresponded with Jean-Guillaume, and he is happy for someone to
pick up the python version and continue developing it, so here I am and
here it is.

I've based my version of the project on github because I prefer working in
git these days, and it's easier for other people to pick it up and carry on
if my enthusiasm wanes at some point in the future.
